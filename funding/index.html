    If you'd like to fund my work or donate a few dimes, here are possible options:

    <ul>
      <li>GitHub Sponsors: <a href="https://github.com/sponsors/paulmillr/">github.com/sponsors/paulmillr/</a></li>
      <!-- <li><code>paulmillr.eth</code> address @ ETH - any currency is accepted</li> -->
    </ul>

    <p>Other options are available upon request.</p>

    <h3>What is the money going to be spent on</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Development of new open-source software</li>
      <li>Maintenance of existing libraries (requires a lot of time on its own)</li>
      <li>Security research</li>
      <li>Hiring third-party security auditors to audit the software</li>
      <li>Education of newcomers</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Take a look at <a href="/noble/">Noble cryptography</a> to understand what i'm working on
      nowadays.</p>

    <p>Thank you!</p>
