  <section class="post-content ecc-form">
    <strong>noble cryptography</strong> is a high-security, auditable set of contained cryptographic libraries and tools with following features:

    <ul>
      <li>No dependencies, tiny files</li>
      <li>Easily auditable TypeScript code</li>
      <li>Supported in all major browsers and stable node.js versions</li>
      <li>All releases are signed with PGP keys</li>
    </ul>

    The idea was to: 1) improve knowledge of cryptography 2) improve supply chain security of JS ecosystem 3) provide libraries that could be used for learning, because other libs are too low-level / unfriendly to beginners. Current libraries:

    <ul>
      <li>curves (<a href="https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-curves">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noble/hashes">NPM</a>): elliptic curve cryptography, including Weierstrass, Edwards, Montgomery curves, pairings, hash-to-curve, poseidon hash, schnorr, secp256k1, ed25519, ed448, p521, bn254 and others. Previously split into separate packages (<a href="https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-secp256k1">noble-secp256k1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-ed25519">noble-ed25519</a>).
      </li>
      <li>hashes (<a href="https://github.com/paulmillr/noble-hashes">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noble/hashes">NPM</a>): SHA2, SHA3, RIPEMD, BLAKE2/3, HMAC, HKDF, PBKDF2 & Scrypt</li>
    </ul>

  <h3>Demo 1: Elliptic curve calculator</h3>
  <p>This is a simple form that allows to calculate elliptic curve public keys and signatures with <strong>noble</strong>. “Random” button uses <code>crypto.getRandomValues</code>, which is cryptographically secure RNG. The source code is <a href="https://github.com/paulmillr/paulmillr.github.io">available on GitHub</a>.</p>
